# 9/80 Schedule

Visualize semi-monthly pay periods while trying to achieve a 9/80 schedule.

## Ancillary goals

1. No external libraries.
2. Don't care about supporting anything but latest versions of major browsers :D

## Greasemonkey script

A userscript is available to display hours in the pay period directly in unanet.

![Userscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/big-beat/bigbeat.io/master/greasemonkey/userscript-screenshot.png)

To install:

1. Install [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).
2. Visit the [userscript](https://github.com/big-beat/bigbeat.io/raw/master/greasemonkey/timesheet.user.js) in your browser and install it.
